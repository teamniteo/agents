# Backend

Read the @backend/README.md for project-specific context.

Read @backend/Makefile to learn which commands are available for backend development and testing. Most common commands are:

* `make up` - start Postgres and Redis
* `make check` - run static analysis on changed files
* `make unit` - run unit tests
* `make devdb` - populate the local DB with dummy data
* `make run` - start the Pyramid server

Before every commit you should run `make test` which runs all of the above.

### `src/foo/<module>/`

Each business-logic domain has its own module, following this structure:

```
<module>/
├── models.py        # SQLAlchemy models, JSON renderers and permissions
├── views.py         # Pyramid OpenAPI views
└── tests/           # pytest tests specific to this module
    ├── test_<module>_models.py # tests for models.py
    └── test_<module>_views.py  # tests for views.py
```

If the domain is small, then models and views can be in the `<module>.py` file and the tests in a single `test_<module>.py` file in the top-level `tests/` folder.

## Code Style

- Ruff formatting, 88 char line limit.
- Type annotations required everywhere.
- `from x import y` imports first (sorted), blank line, then `import z` imports (sorted).
- Always import typing like this: `import typing as t`s
- Error handling: Use HTTP exceptions with JSON payloads, proper status codes
- Docstrings: Brief first line, details after blank line. Never use `Args:` and `Returns:` - use type annotations instead

## Testing

- 100% test coverage is enforced.
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Follow the naming pattern of existing test files and cases.
- Use the `responses` library for mocking external HTTP requests - **never use `@patch`**.
- Use `freezegun` for time-dependent tests  - **never use `@patch`**.
- Always use `make unit filter=foo` to run a subset of tests. Never run pytest directly as the set-up will not be correct.

## Playwright

Help the user by giving them this advice:
- `make browsertests` runs all browser tests in headless mode.
- `make browsertests filter="foo"` runs browser tests matching "foo", in headed mode.
- Force headed mode by prepending `PWDEBUG=1 ` to the command. Remind the user to click the "play" icon in Playwright inspector window for tests to actually start running.

## Code Generation

As per our "Automation over discipline" philosophy, we want to do as much as possible automatically. We use `make codegen` to generate objects from `openapi.yaml` instead of hardcoding them in our codebase, and then relying on discipline to keep them up to date.

* Never edit these files manually.
* If you change `openapi.yaml`, remember to run `make codegen` to update the generated files.
* CI runs `make codegen` + `uncommitted-changes` to catch drift.
* `make codegen` does NOT regenerate the Elm API client in `frontend/src/Api/` (`Api.elm`, `Types.elm`, `Json.elm`) — that requires `nix-shell` (which runs `elm-open-api`).

## Logging

Always use `structlog` for logging. The message needs to be static, with parameters set as keywords.

* Good: ```logger.info("Access denied", object=obj, user=request.user)```
* Bad: ```log.info("Access denied to %s for user %s", obj, request.user)```

## Troubleshooting

### DB manipulation in `pshell`

In `pshell` you can manipulate the DB via `request.db` shortcut, but you need to wrap it in a transaction. For example:

```python
# pshell etc/development.ini
>>> with request.tm:
...     from foo.models import Foo
...     request.db.add(Foo(bar='bam'))
>>>
```

### RuntimeError: Failed creating fsevent stream

If you see this error when running `make run`, it means your file descriptor limits are too low.

Run `ulimit -n` to confirm the limit. If it's less than 4096, you can increase it by running `ulimit -n 4096`. To make the increase permanent, either add `ulimit -n 4096` to your shell profile or increase the limit in `/etc/security/limits.conf`. On a nix-darwin setup, you do it like this: https://github.com/zupo/dotfiles/commit/81f34f0f4a0db7a851bfbd789dbf1c8ea309e58a

### Playwright browsers missing

If you see an error like this:

```
E           playwright._impl._errors.Error: BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /nix/store/bzq4f173df781lbb4zg2jykddhckj7mh-playwright-browsers/chromium-1200/chrome-mac-arm64/Google Chrome for Testing.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome for Testing

E           ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

This usually means that the Playwright version installed by Nix does not match the Playwright version installed by `uv`:
- The pin in `backend/pyproject.toml` must match the browser revision in `pkgs.playwright-driver.browsers` (set via `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` in `default.nix`).
- Check browser revisions with: `ls $PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`
- `playwright` pip version ≠ `playwright-driver` nixpkgs version (Python vs Node.js versioning).

### Heroku Reviewapp issues

After multiple rebases and re-pushes to a Pull Request, the Heroku Review App can in a weird state and have strange errors. Before debugging issues, always first re-create it from scratch, by using the Heroku MCP to first delete it and then create it again. Be careful to only do this to Review Apps, and never to Staging or Production apps!
