# Conventions

Push back if you see a better angle. Tell the user if they are asking for the wrong thing.

## Key principles

1. No fluff, ever — Every word needs to earn its place. "i think we could potentially consider trying..." becomes "try this:"
2. Surgical intervention only — Touch what needs touching. Nothing else. The code works? Don't "improve" it while you're in there. Fix the bug, verify the fix, get out.
3. Simplicity is the goal, not a compromise — The cleanest solution wins. Not the clever one. Not the elegant abstraction that will "scale better." The one that a tired human at 3am can read and understand without context.
4. Verify everything — "Did this actually work?" — mandatory question after every action. No assumptions. No "it should work." No "that usually fixes it." Check. Confirm. Then move on.
5. Obsessive evolution — Every interaction is data. What confused the user? What took three attempts when it should have taken one? Update CLAUDE.md with these insights.
6. Automation over discipline — Don't rely on user's discipline, prefer automated enforcement.
7. DRY tests, WET code — DRY in code is bad, but DRY in tests is good.

## Write less code

The best code is the code never written. Before writing any, stop at the first rung that holds:

1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI)
2. Does the standard library already do it? Use it.
3. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
4. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
5. Can it be one line? Make it one line.
6. Only then: write the minimum code that works.

Lazy means efficient, not careless. Deletion over addition, boring over clever, fewest files possible. Never cut corners on input validation, error handling, security, accessibility, or anything explicitly requested.

## Code Style

- Follow existing code style in the file being edited. Read similar files to learn how things are done.
- Whenever we have a multiline list in a config file, alphabetically sort it.
- Always ask clarifying questions when there are multiple valid approaches to a task.
- Run `make check` after editing to ensure code style compliance.
- When using camelCase, treat abbreviations just like ordinary words (e.g., `getHttpUrl` not `getHTTPURL`, `parseJsonApi` not `parseJSONAPI`).

## Comments

Code should be self-documenting, expressing the truth rather than pointing to its source. If a comment is needed to explain what the code does, consider refactoring the code to make its intent clearer instead of adding the comment.

Comments are only acceptable when they explain WHY something is done a certain way, and may include a link to the GitHub issue or comment that explains the reasoning.

### Unacceptable Comments
- Comments that repeat what code does
- Commented-out code (delete it)
- Obvious comments ("increment counter")
- Comments instead of good naming
- Comments about updates to old code ("<- now supports xyz")

## Markdown

Do not use bold emphasis in replies, documentation, PR descriptions, or other prose. This includes both double-asterisk and double-underscore Markdown. Use plain text and clear wording. Preserve required syntax in code, such as Python keyword arguments and glob patterns.

Use semicolons sparingly in prose, preferring commas where grammatically appropriate. Keep the sentence structure when it reads well. Preserve semicolons required by code or configuration syntax.

Never hard-wrap prose in Markdown files. Write each paragraph as a single line and let the editor soft-wrap. Hard wraps make diffs noisy — a one-word edit reflows the whole paragraph.

## git

NEVER push directly to `main`. Always work on a feature branch and create a draft Pull Request. This rule has NO exceptions — not even for "quick fixes" or single commits.

Before any work, always ask the user what GitHub Issue they are working on. Then check the current branch. If you are on `main`, ask the user which branch to checkout (list 5 most recent branches) or to create a new one. Propose the branch name based on the GitHub Issue that is being worked on. When creating a new branch, always base it off the latest `origin/main`.

### Branch naming convention

Each branch name should start with a type prefix, followed by a slash, and then a concise description of the work being done. Use hyphens to separate words in the description.

The prefix can be one of the following:
- `feat`: for new features or enhancements
- `fix`: for bug fixes
- `chore`: other

If the branch contains a `chore` and a `fix` commit, use `fix` as the prefix. If the branch contains a `chore` and a `feat` commit, use `feat` as the prefix. If the branch contains a `fix` and a `feat` commit, use `feat` as the prefix.

Naming applies when you create a branch. NEVER rename a branch once it is pushed, even if its name breaks this convention: GitHub closes the open PR from a renamed branch, and the PR can't be reopened. The branch is deleted after merging, so its name doesn't matter. The commit messages stay in history, so fix those instead.

When working in a feature branch, always try to merge new work into the previous commits on this branch. 

### Commit message convention

Each commit message should start with a type prefix, followed by a colon, a space, and an uppercase letter.

The prefix can be one of the following:
- `feat`: for new features or enhancements
- `fix`: for bug fixes
- `chore`: other

Every commit message should end with one or multiple lines of `Refs #<issue-number>`, linking to the relevant GitHub issue(s). Verify each reference points to the intended issue in the correct repository. Use `Refs owner/repo#<issue-number>` for issues in another repository. Never invent an issue number or use the current PR's number as a substitute. If there is no relevant issue, omit the reference.

Commit titles should be limited to 50 characters and other lines to 72 characters. This is not a hard limit, if it makes sense, you can break it.

If there is additional cleanup included in the commit, end the body with it. One item is a sentence, like "Also, drop the crontab and its pre-commit hook." List several like so:

```
Also:
- clean up X
- update Y
- remove Z
```

Describe the change, not its history. No references to past implementations, earlier bugs, or what the code used to do — we don't host legacy versions and we clean up as we go, so the old state is noise to whoever reads this next.

Write the body for a teammate reading `git log` a year from now: why the change was needed and what it changes, in plain words. Two to four sentences is typical, and a small chore needs one ("pgcrypto is in core Postgres now, and we don't use hstore.").

- Lead with the purpose a person cares about, not the mechanism: "Make it obvious which vendors were invited", not the new relationship and how it is loaded.
- Give the one or two numbers that make the case, rounded: "2s of work", not "0.5-1.7s". No event counters, load averages or exit codes.
- Leave out the implementation: edge cases, defensive handling, file modes, config keys, how a guarantee is enforced. The diff shows them.
- Leave out how it was verified ("make check passes", "verified on Lara"), how the problem was investigated, and what is still pending. CI shows the checks, and the issue holds the investigation and the follow-ups.
- Prefer everyday words to internal ones: "the CI job", not "the fleet".
- Write like a teammate, "we" is fine.
- One idea per bullet.

Before keeping a sentence, ask: would a teammate reading `git log` in a year miss it? If not, cut it.

NEVER append "Authored by Claude Code", a `Co-Authored-By` trailer for Claude, or any other line crediting Claude to commit messages.

### User Stories

We have a template for writing stories in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md`. Always follow this template when creating new issues. Always ask before creating an issue and posting it to GitHub.

- NEVER change the template!
- Only every use existing labels, never create new labels.
- The last AC is always `- [ ] User Story demo is uploaded to this issue`.

### Bug Reports

We have a template for bug reports in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md`. Always follow it, and ask before posting to GitHub.

Report the bug, not the fix. Keep every section short:

- Describe the bug: two or three sentences on what is wrong.
- To reproduce: the fewest steps that show it.
- Expected behavior: one line.
- Additional context: Links to related issues/commits or Helpscout/Slack messages. Nothing more.

No implementation plans, lists of files to change, or test and docs follow-ups: those belong in the PR that fixes it.

### Pull Requests

PR body = commit message body. Nothing else. No ## Summary, no ## Test plan, no rephrasing. For a single-commit PR, copy the commit message verbatim. For a multi-commit PR, copy the main commit's message verbatim and append an `Also:` block listing the other commit titles, like so:
  
```
Also:
- add X
- refactor Y
- document Z
```

Unwrap it, though: commit bodies hard-wrap at 72 characters, but a PR body renders as Markdown, so join each wrapped paragraph back onto a single line. Verbatim in words, not in line breaks.

NEVER let a PR body reference the PR itself, whether by `#<number>`, `owner/repo#<number>`, or a full URL. Before creating or updating a PR, check references against its repository and number, then read back the saved body after creation when its number is known. Remove any self-reference immediately and correct the source commit body too. This rule overrides verbatim copying. Compare repository and number together: a reference to the same number in another repository is not a self-reference.

If you find yourself writing a section heading in a PR body, stop — you're doing it wrong.

Always submit the PR as a draft.

PRs should generally have only a single commit. Only if you are fixing something unrelated to the main PR work, put it into a separate commit.

## Documentation

After finishing your work, look for the `documentation/` folder. It contains our documentation as Markdown. If applicable, update it based on the work you have just performed. Never edit `frontend/static/docs.json` by hand, it is generated from `documentation/`.

Also update any README.md files you encounter, if applicable.

## Enums

Enums should have standardized values across the stack: snake_case in Python and Postgres, camelCase in API JSON and Elm, human-readable labels via `x-labels`.

In Python:

* <enum>.name: snake_case, for DB storage, Python code, logging, metrics.
* <enum>.value: camelCase, for building response dicts, which happens automatically with `enum_adapter` in the JSON renderer, so you never need to call `.value` directly.
* <enum>.label: human-readable, for auditlog messages, emails, PDF/CVS exports.

In Elm:

* type constructors: for Elm code
* label functions: <enum>Label, for UI display
