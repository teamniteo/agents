# Niteo Claude

Claude Code configuration shared across all Niteo projects and all Niteans.

## Projects

Projects use `rules/` from this repo in their work folders to tell Claude how our code looks like, what conventions to follow, and what commands are available.

Any project-specific instructions are added to the project's own `CLAUDE.md`.

### Example

Projects pin this repo as a flake input and symlink `rules/` and `skills/` into `.claude/` from their devShell.

1. Add this repo as a flake input (`nix/flake.nix`):

   ```nix
   inputs.niteo-agents.url = "github:teamniteo/agents";
   ```

2. Fetch it as a source (`nix/default.nix`):

   ```nix
   niteoAgentsNode = flakeLock.nodes.${flakeLock.nodes.root.inputs.niteo-agents};

   flakeSources.niteo-agents = builtins.fetchTarball {
     url = "https://github.com/teamniteo/agents/archive/${niteoAgentsNode.locked.rev}.tar.gz";
     sha256 = niteoAgentsNode.locked.narHash;
   };
   ```

3. Symlink `rules/` and `skills/` into `.claude/` from the devShell's `shellHook`:

   ```nix
   shellHook = ''
     mkdir -p "$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude"
     ln -sfn ${pkgs.flakeSources.niteo-agents}/rules  "$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/rules"
     ln -sfn ${pkgs.flakeSources.niteo-agents}/skills "$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/skills"
   '';
   ```

4. Reference the shared rules from the project's `CLAUDE.md`:

   ```markdown
   Make sure to use common @.claude/rules/tooling.md and follow the
   @.claude/rules/conventions.md when working in this repo.
   ```

Bump the shared config project-wide with `nix flake update niteo-agents`.

## Niteans

Niteans use skills and MCPs from this repo in their HomeManager setup of Claude, so that it gains Niteo-specific capabilities.

Niteans are free to expand with their personal tooling or preferences, and are encouraged to generalize and contribute back to this repo for other Niteans to benefit.


# Convention

## Skills instead of Commands

Commands were merged into [Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) in v2.1.3. Let's use Skills from now on.

## No need for Plugins

Because we use HomeManager to manage Claude Code, we don't need to use [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).
